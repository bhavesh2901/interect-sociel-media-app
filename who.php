Who can use Interact?<br>
3. Your commitments to Interact and our community
We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
1. Who can use Interact
When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:
•	Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
•	provide accurate information about yourself;
•	Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
•	not share your password, give access to your Interact account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).
We try to make Interact broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Interact if:
•	You are under 13 years old.
•	You are a convicted sex offender.
•	We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the Community Standards or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Interact. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the Community Standards or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
•	You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.
2. What you can share and do on Interact Products
We want people to use Interact Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):
1.	You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
•	That violates these Terms, the Community Standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of our Products.
•	That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
•	That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
•	That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
2.	You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.	You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access.
4.	You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.	You may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, except as provided in the Platform Terms.
6.	You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.B.
If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the Community Standards, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.B below.
To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction.
We also can remove or restrict access to content features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Interact.
3. The permissions you give us
We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
1.	Permission to use content that you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Interact and other Interact Project Products that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.
However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "License") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.
Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Interact, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Interact Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.
You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. Learn more about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.
It may take up to ninety days to delete content after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in thirty days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another ninety days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
Content will not be deleted within ninety days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
•	where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted);
•	where deletion within ninety days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
•	Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
•	investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
•	protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
•	comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Interact Project providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
•	comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
2.	Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Interact next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Interact Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Interact. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Interact Products. You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.
3.	Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.
4. Limits on using our intellectual property
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Interact), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the Interact Bug Bounty Programme.
