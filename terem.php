        Terms <br><br>
       
        Interact builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of Interact, Messenger and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we offer (the Interact Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Interact Platforms, Inc.<br><br>

We don't charge you to use Interact or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.<br><br>

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Interact Products.<br><br>

Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings pages of the relevant Interact Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1. The services we provide<br><br>
Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you:
Provide a personalised experience for you:<br>
Your experience on Interact is unlike anyone else's: from the Posts, Stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Interact News Feed or our video platform to the Interact Pages that you follow and other features you might use, such as Interact Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.<br><br>
Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:
We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Interact Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Interact Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.<br><br>
Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
There are many ways to express yourself on Interact to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Interact Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Interact Products.
Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:
We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Interact and other Interact Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.
Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
People will only build community on Interact Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across Interact Project when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Interact Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Interact Project that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Interact may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our Privacy Policy.<br><br>

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more here.
Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Interact or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.
Research ways to make our services better:
We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Privacy Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.
Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Interact Project Products:
Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Interact Project Products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Interact to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Interact through Messenger.
Ensuring access to our services:
To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Interact Platforms, Inc., Interact Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.
